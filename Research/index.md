### RNN-based sequence learning for text generation

* Trying to incorprate paragraph-level information into text generation.
* Baseline implemented in Tensorflow, final model implemented with Torch7.
* Results submitted to ACL'17.

* Proposed to evaluate labeling sequences using **sentence-level log-likelihood (SLL)** at output layer of deep recurrent neural networks. Empirical results showed around 4% improvement on F-measure of opinion target extraction and more accurate n-best ranking for labeling sequences.

* Proposed to use deep recurrent neural networks to produce the n-best labeling sequences which can be fed into integer linear programming (ILP) system for joint inference.  

* Designed heuristic rules using dependency parse tree to eliminate inappropriate opinion candidates during inference. Empirical results showed higher precision and higher F-measure. 

* Building an ensemble system using the above algorithm to participate in Belief and Sentiment Evaluation 2015 **(BeSt2015)**.

### Online Auction Mechanism Design with Time-varying Value
_Research assistant at  Advanced Network Laboratory, Shanghai Jiao Tong University_       

* Proposed the new scenario in online auction mechanism design where agentâ€™s value may vary over time.

* Extended the classic payment determination algorithm (Myerson) to fit the new model. Proposed mechansim ensured strategy-proofness and achieved constant competitive ratio.
