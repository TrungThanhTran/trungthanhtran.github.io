     {Neural Networks Approach for Fine-grained Opinion Extraction}{Ithaca, NY, USA}
    {NLP group, Cornell University}
    {\textit{Aug. 2015 -- Dec. 2015}}
    {
    \begin{itemize}
     \item{ \textit{Advisor: Claire Cardie}}
    % \item{ Improving and implementing deep learning algorithms to do fine-grained opinion extraction. }
    
    \item{Designed heuristic rules using dependency parse tree to eliminate inappropriate opinion candidates during inference. Empirical results showed higher precision and higher F-measure.}
    
    \item{Proposed to use deep recurrent neural networks to produce the \textit{n-best} labeling sequences, which can be fed into integer linear programming (ILP) system for joint inference.}
    
	 \item{Proposed to evaluate labeling sequences using \textbf{Sentence-Level Log-Likelihood (SLL)} at the output layer of deep recurrent neural networks. Empirical results showed over \textbf{5\%} improvement on F-measure of opinion target extraction and accurate  ranking for \textit{n-best} labeling sequences. }%
	 
	 \item{ Building an ensemble system using the above algorithm to participate in Belief and Sentiment Evaluation 2015 (\textbf{BeSt2015}).}
